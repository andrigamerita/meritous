MERITOUS v 1.2 (Miyoo port v0.1)
for Miyoo (Bittboy / PocketGo / PowKiddy V90/Q90)
by octospacc, originally by Lancer-X/ASCEAI

Far below the surface of the planet is a secret.     
A place of limitless power. Those that seek to
control such a utopia will soon bring an end        
to themselves.                       

Seeking an end to the troubles that plague him,
PSI user MERIT journeys into the hallowed Orcus
Dome in search of answers.

HINT:
If the game is too difficult for you, you can play in 'Wuss mode' for a far more sombre gaming experience.

BASIC CONTROLS:
* D-PAD - Move around. To walk through doors, simply walk up to them and push against them.
* B - Charge your PSI circuit.
* L - View the map (you can then use the D-PAD/JOY to scroll around the map.
* R - View the help file.
* START - Activate a trigger tile that you are standing on.
START is also used for various other things, such as
for reading in-game dialogue.
* SELECT - Pause/Exit the game.

COMMENTS:
You can send comments/questions/whatever to my email address, which is
given on the website.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
Thanks to my beta testers: Quasar, Terryn and Wervyn, for their hard work
in assisting me in keeping Meritous fairly stable.
